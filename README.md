# Key-Logger
The Key logger detects all the information that has been typed onto the keyboard and maintains its logs in a log file. The key logger is also able to send information over the Gmail server, for that purpose Gmail API is used. Furthermore, the key logger will be made undetectable, so that its presence may not be detected and it may run in the background.
